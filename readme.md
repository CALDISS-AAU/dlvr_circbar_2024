# Circular barplot notebook

This repository contains a notebook for creating circular barplots for a specific dataset. The purpose of the notebook is to provide the intended users (Aalborg University researchers) with a simple interface for loading their data, selecting a specific observation and creating a circular barplot of the data for that observation while allowing for minimum configuration options (like bar colours, label values).

The data contained in this repository is simulated and meant for testing, and does not reflect real people or real observations. 

All functionality is contained within the nobtebook `gen_cirbarplot.ipynb` and dependecies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

All supporting text and comments is written in Danish.
